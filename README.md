#Explanation

The tests came from the truth table and the Karnaugh maps. After determining the minterm 
values and equations, the schematics were designed to fit the truth table. There are pictures in the repository of the truth table, the Karnaugh maps and the schematic. 

#Demos
1. Lab Notebook - Yes
2. 3 bit test - Yes
3. 8 bit test
 
#Debugging and Testing

Debugging and testing the 3 bit section was not that difficult. The prelab exercises helped remove any errors ahead of time. The 8 bit section however gave me some trouble. I had some syntax errors to deal with in addition to silly mistakes. In the end, both sections functioned properly. 

#Documentation & Comments

I received a lot of help in EI fro Dr Neebel because I was sick. I also had trouble uploading the .ucf file for the 3 bit section. Josh Hayden helped me upload the file to GitHub.
